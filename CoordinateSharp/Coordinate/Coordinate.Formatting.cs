/*
CoordinateSharp is a .NET standard library that is intended to ease geographic coordinate 
format conversions and location based celestial calculations.

Many celestial formulas in this library are based on Jean Meeus's 
Astronomical Algorithms (2nd Edition). Comments that reference only a chapter
are referring to this work.

CoordinateSharp is a simple .NET library written in C# that is designed to assist with geographic coordinate conversions, parsing, formatting, magnetic data, and location based celestial calculations such as sunset, sunrise, moonset, moonrise and more.

### Like CoordinateSharp? Tell us about it!

This library was built to help other developers. Please make the time and effort worth while by [telling us what you are using it for](https://github.com/Tronald/CoordinateSharp/issues/79).

### Prerequisites
.NET 4.0+ Framework, .NET 5.0+, or .NET Standard 1.3+ compatible runtimes.

### Installing
CoordinateSharp is available as a nuget package from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CoordinateSharp/)

Alternatively, you may download the library directly [on our website](https://www.coordinatesharp.com/Download)

### Licensing & Purchase

CoordinateSharp is split licensed. You may use CoordinateSharp for free under the [AGPL-3.0](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3/) (requires software to be open source) or a commercial use license that absolves you of the AGPL-3.0 open source requirements. Details as well as pricing may be viewed [on our website](https://coordinatesharp.com/Licensing).

### Usage Example

CoordinateSharp is simple to use. In the below example we can create a `Coordinate` using one of the methods below.

```csharp
//Seattle coordinates on 5 Jun 2018 @ 10:10 AM (UTC)
//Signed-Decimal Degree    47.6062, -122.3321
//Degrees Minutes Seconds  N 47º 36' 22.32" W 122º 19' 55.56"

/***********************************************************/

//Initialize with signed degree (standard method)
Coordinate c = new Coordinate(47.6062, -122.3321, new DateTime(2018,6,5,10,10,0));

//OR simply parse from a string
Coordinate c = Coordinate.Parse("N 47º 36.372' W 122º 19.926'", new DateTime(2018,6,5,10,10,0);
```

Once the `Coordinate` is created we have access to various formats and celestial data. Here are just a few examples.
 
 ```C#
Console.WriteLine(c);                              // N 47º 36' 22.32" W 122º 19' 55.56"
Console.WriteLine(c.Latitude.Seconds);             // 22.32
Console.WriteLine(c.UTM);                          // 10T 550200mE 5272748mN

Console.WriteLine(c.CelestialInfo.SunSet);         // 5-Jun-2018 4:02:00 AM
Console.WriteLine(c.CelestialInfo.MoonAltitude);   // 14.4169966277874
```

### Extension Packages

Extension packages are being built to work in conjunction with CoordinateSharp. Currently available extension packages may be downloaded via Nuget.org. Documentation for extension packages is contained in the main documentation of the library and can be found [on our website](https://coordinatesharp.com/).

* **CoordinateSharp.Magnetic** - Calculate location based magnetic field elements.

### Performance Tips

CoordinateSharp's ease of use comes from its eager loaded architecture. This approach may come at the cost of performance at times, but luckily the eager loading of certain properties can be turned off to improve benchmarks. For example if you only need MGRS conversions, you can turn off celestial calculations and improve `Coordinate` initialization by 6-10ms.

It is highly recommended that developers reference our [Performance Tips Page](https://coordinatesharp.com/Performance) once they have become familiar with the basic usage of 
CoordinateSharp.

### Abilities
 
* **Lat/Long formatting:** Quickly format how a coordinate is output.
* **Coordinate conversions:** Convert Geodetic Latitude / Longitude to UTM, MGRS, Cartesian (Spherical and ECEF), Web Mercator (EPSG:3857), GEOREF or vice versa.
* **Coordinate parsing:** Initialize a `Coordinate` with multiple format types using `TryParse()`.
* **Distance calculation:** Calculate distances between coordinates.
* **Coordinate moving/shifting:** Shift coordinates using a distance and bearing, or a distance and target coordinate.
* **Location based celestial information:** Quickly determine sun set, moon rise, next solar eclipse or even zodiac signs at the input location.
* **Property change notification:** All properties automatically adjust as the `Coordinate` changes. For example, changing the `GeoDate` will cause all celestial times to recalculate. Adjusting a `Coordinate` latitudinal seconds, will retrigger all coordinate conversions and celestial data so your information is always up to date. 
* **Geo-Fencing:** Define a perimeter and determine if your coordinate is within or near polylines.
* **Magnetic Data:** Determine geographic magnetic data such as declination ([requires extension package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CoordinateSharp.Magnetic/)).
